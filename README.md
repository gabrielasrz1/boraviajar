# Bora Viajar - Vite + React + Tailwind (starter)

This is a starter project generated for the user. It includes the single-file React component `App.jsx` (Bora Viajar landing page).

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```
npm run build
```

Notes:
- Tailwind needs to be installed (devDependencies included). If you prefer a simpler static build, let me know and I can provide a plain HTML/CSS version.
- Replace placeholder images and update contact info in `src/App.jsx`.
